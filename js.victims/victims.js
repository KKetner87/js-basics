//1. First we need to use a prompt to ask the user how many victims to enter.
// 2. Next, we need to ask for the victim's info: name, number, and street.
//    a. store this info in 3 seperate arrays, one for each seperate piece of info, using the .push method.
//3. Then we need to continue this loop for the number of victims entered.
// 4. We need to repeat all the above steps and include the data in a seperate array for volenteers.
//5. At the end, print out  in a single alert, the number of victims, the number of volunteers, and a list of all victims and all volunteers.
