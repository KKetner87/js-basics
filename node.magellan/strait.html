At 52Â°S latitude on 21 October 1520, the fleet reached Cape Virgenes and concluded they had found the passage, 
    because the waters were brine and deep inland. Four ships began an arduous trip through the 373-mile (600 km) long passage 
    that Magellan called the Estrecho (Canal) de Todos los Santos, ("All Saints' Channel"), because the fleet travelled through 
    it on 1 November or All Saints' Day. The strait is now named the Strait of Magellan.
