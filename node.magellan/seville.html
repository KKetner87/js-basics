      Magellan underestimated the size of the oceans, and thought he could find a faster route to the Spice Islands by sailing west. 
      Interested in Magellan's proposal to find a faster shipping route to the Far East, the Spanish king granted Magellan abundant
      funds. With the money, Magellan purchased five ships: the Conception, the Santiago, the San Antonio, the Trinidad, and the Victoria.
      The fleet left harbor in September of 1519 with 275 men and adequate provisions for only a few months.
